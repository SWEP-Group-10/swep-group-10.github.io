				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Israel Alagbe. I invented the pathogen
					zapper in 2013. I was inspired by Dr. Hulder Clark who invented the first zapper
					in 1994. I am a writer, health consultant, independent researcher and inventor.
					<br />
					Pathogen zapper is an electronics device that kills parasites using electricity and
					resonance. Pathogen zapper is an improvement of the original Dr. Hulder Clark zapper.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="liner" src="images/image.jpg" /> Cells that are in the process of division are vulnerable to damage by electric fields
					that have specific frequency and field strength characteristics. The selective distruption
					of rapidly dividing cells can therefore be accomplished by imposing an AC electric field in
					a target region for extended period of time.Some of the cells that divide while the field is
					applied will be damaged, but the cells that do not devide will not be harmed.
					This selectively damages or disrupts rapidly dividing dividing cells like parasites, but does not
					harm normal cells that are not dividing.

				<h3 class="first" id="ancient">Ancient Electrotherapy</h3>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using electricity to reduce pain or restore vitality are not a new ideas. It was used in A.D. 46 when Doctor to the Roman emperor, Scrilhonius Largus, immersed sick people in water containing Electric Fish to relieve painful areas, and treat some painful headaches. The device is similar to today's T.E.N.S devices(transcutaneous electrical
					nerve stimulation).
					<h3 class="first" id="science">Scientists Discouveries</h3>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 20s, Dr. Royal Raymond Rife  developed a microscope which has a magnification of 60000
					which he used with a frequency generator to study micro-organisms .(Today's Electron microscopes has higher magnification, but its limitation is that it can only be used to see dead organisms.) Rife placed live bacteria, viruses on petri
					dishes and applied frequency signals from his frequency generator.
					This signals will render these organisms unable to reproduce, or resonate their membrane walls to the point of collapse.
					He observed that pathogens and
					malignant cells die while healthy tissues remained unharmed. Organised medicine called Rife a  quack and destroyed his equipments, but some of his equipments and documents survived.
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Hulder Clack used Rife frequency generator to zap one pathogen after the other but this was time consuming. &nbsp; Before zapping individual pathogens, the user has to set the specific frequencies at which individual pathogens vibrates.  In 1994, her son built a small battery operated device to kill internal fluke. To her surprice, the battery-operated device killed all the pathogen without having to set to a particular frequency. She named the device "ZAPPER"

				<h3 class="first" id="superior">Zapper Technology</h3>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Hulda Clark Zapper has a limitations. To get any result from the zapper you have to zap for hours. Parasites may develop resistance to the zapper's current. That is why I re-invented the zapper.
					The secret to the power of the Pathogen Zapper is powerful
					multiplifier effect created by interaction of harmonics and duty-cycle and voltage ratio of the zapper. There is no need to zap endlessly for hours to get results.

				<h4>HIV</h4><br />
				<p>Richard B.: My HIV+ friend got your zapper. In 6 months without any medication his blood samples showed a
				viral load less than 500 (down from 50,000). His doctor only wants to see him once a year.
				He's very happy... April 12, 2014</p>

					Pathogen Zapper is easy to use. It consist 2 electrodes which is held in both hands.
					Just flip the switch &amp; zap for
					<br />
					some minutes depending on your sensitivity.
