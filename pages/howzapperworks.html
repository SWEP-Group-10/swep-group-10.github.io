						&nbsp; The zapper is an electronic device invented by Dr. Hulder Clark.
						. The zapper creates a kind of wave that resonate at only one frequency but due to <a class="colorred" href="#">Harmonics</a>, 
						the zapper will resonate at multiple frequencies. 
						The zapper resonates at specific frequencies at which pathogens vibrates with positive offset square wave.
					</p><h3>Negative Ions</h3>
					<p>
						Electric current. Zapper introduces negative electric charges into the body's tissues and selective distrupt rapidly dividing. 
						It does not harm nearby tissues that are not dividing. Parasites are positively charged and likewise unhealthy tissues. 
						The electric field released from the zapper. Pathogens can not defend themselves against shortage of electrons during the 
						introduction of the zapper's current. 
						Negative ions will repel parasites when when subjected to electric current.
					</p><h3>Resonance &amp; Harmonics</h3>
					<p>
						Everything has its own natural vibrating frequency (resonance) regardless of if it is a livingthing or non-livingthing. 
						Resonance is a phenomenon whereby vibration is created at the specific frequency at which objects naturally vibrates.
						<br />
						Bridges also exhibit the principle of resonance. 
						Military units marching while crossing a bridge are known to create a natural frequency at which the bridge vibrates--providing amplification.

					<h3>Microscope Test</h3>
					<p>
						The zapper has been demonstrated. The following images and videos are taken based on the testing of Pathogen Zapper using a microscope.
