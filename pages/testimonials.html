<div class="first"><h3>Terminal Liver Cancer</h3><div class="number">1</div>
 <p>ON A
 FORUM </p>
<p>I underwent a surgery to remove part of liver last June.
 I'm 78 years old now. After the surgery I made extensive research on the net for
 fear of recurrence. I don't take any anti-cancer drugs as I was told they have only harms
 and no benefits at hospital. I tried herbal treatment according to Hulda Clark's "cancer = virus
 theory", taking Chinese medicinal herbs for three months, whose name I forgot. I tried everything 
that is said to be beneficial. From fasting to fucoidan, believe me, I tried everything. But I take
 nothing now. I've found the final thing that is guaranteed to stop recurrence. I was sentenced to
 have only three months to live and the people around me were all disappointed when I tried this
 and simply got cured. My doctor was amazed. It is Pathogen Zapper.</p><P>Yurii M.<br />

<h3>EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS
(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)</h3><div class="number">2</div><P>
 Dear Israel,<br /><br />

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

I'm functioning and well!! I can't believe it.
 Have been progressively getting worst for 10 years with Epstein-Barr 
virus/Mono. When I ordered the Zapper I was not functioning ... sleeping 12 hours,
 waking up exhausted, laying in the chair all day, too tired to watch TV. Have been
 zapping faithfully since late October and am a normal human being again. There are no words
 ... <br />as I have owned
 two successful businesses I could crank it up ...

Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Janice<br />DEC. 5, 2014</P><h3>
WORMS LITERALLY BEING EXECUTED</h3><div class="number">3</div>
<p> Good to hear<br /><br />

... for what it is worth Israel, I zap twice daily and have for months
 ... I do take a week off once in a while but my river blindness parasite 
was so extensive I had no idea and I felt a need to stay with the zapping daily as 
the infection was so large ... I have killed perhaps as many as one thousand worms and 
that is no exaggeration ... i have many that I have kept and are frozen as I do want to 
find a parasitologist to confirm the parasite ... I have done well over 100 colonics and 
over one thousand enemas in the past 14 months as I had to in order to move the dead worms 
and debris out ... there is no other protocol that would have been as effective as your zapper.
 I literally have zapped by sitting on one handhold and securing the other handhold on my transverse
 colon area and then putting the two hndles on the handhold right under my rib cage ... 
my guess is they have been encased in a cyst of some type.

I first became alarmed 5 years ago when I starting seeing snake skin like debris in my stool and
 it got worse and I began to have really erratic bowel movements. I took samples to the hospital
 twice and was told I was fine and so for three to four years I did nothing. During this time they
 just hatched and took over. Well, it has taken 14 months of twice daily zapping and colon cleansing
 and I am now close to being parasite free. My skin, my eyes, my complexion and energy have gone 
from terrible to people look at me and many have asked what I have done ... I do not share this with 
anyone but my wife and son. Truthfully, most people could not handle it and I am not sure I care to
 share anyway. They just see that I have lost 15 to 20 years of age and that is not a stretch. 
When I look at pictures of myself prior to zapping and purging the parasites I cannot believe it was me.

Your zapper saved my life. I tried everything and nothing worked. As I zapped 
I felt the mass of worms pulsating, literally being electrocuted there were so many 
and the strangest thing occurred each and every day from one to maybe as many as 4 to 
5 worms died and several were 10 to 20 inches long and all had little round heads on them.
 I do not know why the zapper killed them this way but I really never got sick. I would experience 
out of body feelings and foggy brain until I did an enema and got them out and then I felt great.
 I did this twice per day starting July of 2010 and continue to do two enemas a day and my colon
 is functioning at a level it has not functioned at since I was a child. I have also done a
 complete dental revision and removed 7 amalgams and four cavitations. My energy is unreal.
 My ability to think clearly is unreal. Israel, I hope you take great pride in what you have created 
and the gift you have given to so many people. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I close by saying that the zapper has been a miracle !<br /><br />

Sept. 20, 2011</p><h3>Cured From Thyroid Disorder</h3><div class="number">4</div><p>
Hello there Israel & good day!<br /><br />

A couple of things:

My wife is totally cured from her thyroid disorder and her Doctor can simply not believe his eyes. Her hormonal levels are better than normal -- even being pregnant as she is, her Thyroid gland is functioning as if she was 20 -- and she is 37 as I told you in one of my previous messages -- for which I will be eternally grateful to you and what your Pathogen Zapper has done to her healing ... Israel -- no kidding -- I really have no words to express my most exalted gratitude for all good you've done to the current state of health of both my wife & myself through sharing your experiences and indications -- I will not use the word "advice" for the sake of argumentation -- and making your invention available to the world. Again, many thanks for all dearly.<br /><br />

Aug. 26, 2013</p><h3>FLESH DISEASE</h3></p><div class="number">5</div><p> Good to hear ...<br /><br />

Just wanted to tell you about my recent scare with flesh eating disease. A couple of months ago we went to Mexico. We went out for dinner one night, and the owner of the restaurant was making his rounds to the customers tables. My husband said ' how's it going' and he answered, well, we have a water problem, so we have to bring it in from next door. Well, we just continued to eat our dinner ... The next day, I didn't feel well. Took some medication, didn't help. A week later, came home, went to the doctor. Gave me a prescription, took some tests, still didn't help. The tests came back with Aeromonas hydrophyla. Woke up one morning with holes around my stomach and back. I looked them up, saw exactly the same holes on others and animals. Looked up aeromonas hydrophyla, flesh eating disease ... My family was panicking ... Went to a tropical disease specialist, more tests, more medication. Then I remembered my zapper. Next day, the holes were not raw, you could see the bug was dead. The holes started to shrink and heal, but left scars. Thank you for your zapper, I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />

Dec. 29, 2013 </p><h3>Cat Testimonial</h3><div class="number">6</div><p>Dear Israel,<br /><br />

I would like to place my testimony about my cat, who was dying, and the doctor veterinarian told me to pay to him $186 dollars to put my cat to sleep (she is 6 years old!) and another $185 for cemetery, because my cat will die anyway. My cat can not go to the bathroom, could not breath, was whistling all over, vomiting, shaking and discoordinated. Since I bought your zapper several months ago (and I did some research on internet before I paid, also talked with my friend who has clinic of alternative medicine, and she recommended me completely different one, but costs twice more) my cat now eats, plays, running like crazy around the house, almost well coordinated, and her breathing almost normal. I also found unusual use of your zapper for treatment any other diseases in combination with superficial electroacupuncture and treated successfully eczema, asthma, fibromyalgia, and continue to work with your equipment for more applications.<br /><br />

Dec. 29, 2014</p><h3>Cat Testimonial</h3><div class="number">8</div><p> PART 1<br /><br />

It's only been 8 days since i called my vet and cancelled macaroon the cat's sub-Q appts - mainly because the stress of even going to the vet is too much for him, he was dying.

Macaroon is approximately 18 years old, a creme colored siamese cat who was a stray that lived and suffered on the rough streets in the late 1990's when i took him in finally in 1998. he was approximately 8 years old, starving, full of cuts from fighting, had matted fur that smelled of strong male spray (urine), completely yellow and brown and broken teeth (many missing), and had some kind of burn along his rear end (like a baboon where it's all red and no fur). In 1998 i found him laying sick behind some bushes he had a large trail of ants leading to his red and raw area, as if it were just food garbage on the ground. he was so sick he just laid there and let them crawl on and inside his cuts. After clearing him up and having him bathed and taking him to the vet, within 30 days or so he became a very beautiful cat and all his fur grew in and he was a brand new cat. he continued to live outdoors, but in the protection of rain and the elements in my backyard where he had plenty of food, water, shelter, and my other cats to hang out with. He was very happy and fat and a beautiful ex-tom cat--still getting in a scruff or two with my cats to exert his authority, but now fixed and homebound. I share that story to illustrate that street cats sometimes have more endurance and can miraculously get by somehow fairing better than the usual housecat.

However, as the years went by he approached old age, about 4 months ago he came down with numerous ailments. He would vomit after every meal, started getting that "wasting" syndrome where he looked dehydrated and extremely thin and his bones seem brittle, like an elderly person. I had a few blood tests and vet examinations done and the results were:

1. Complete shriveled and kidney failure of 1 kidney and the other in a weakened condition and soon to be like the other. His urine test showed blood in the urine consistently for 3 months and 3 different blood tests despite the antibiotics.

2. Pancreatitis with extreme levels 4x the normal--this alone could have taken his life and this caused the vomiting and the weight loss and dehydration

3. Dehydrated, sunken eyes 4. His once 13 lbs, now down to 7 lbs, and recently got as low as 5 lbs. This would be like a 180 lb man getting down to 90 lbs and then 40 lbs. Just a skeleton.

5. Terrible brown goop in his ears, not ear mites, but an ongoing infection, possibly yeast the vet said.

6. Very bad teeth, probably causing the constant flow of bacteria which no doubt had a lot to do with his kidneys becoming bad.

7. a ping-pong sized tumor on his right abdomen, not know if it was cancerous or not

The vet suggested we put him to sleep.

I went to another vet to get a 2nd opinion and the new vet said things weren't that bleak to put him to sleep just yet and she tried sub-Q treatments on him and changed his diet and gave him kidney herbs, we had wonderful results, he started eating better and seemed to be very happy. But his weight slowly decreased and as of 8 days ago i called the vet and discontinued his treatments telling her "it's time, Macaroon is ready to die." I noticed he was displaying the "death rattle" (walking out of balance, disoriented, sitting close to the wall facing the wall, not eating at all, and when i'd call him he would look around not knowing what direction i was calling him, and when my other kitty came up to him and rubbed him to greet him, he was so frail he fell over). All he did was lie there and not look up, he would eat only a little bit and I was mostly feeding him special food through an oral syringe. i was preparing for his death. I figured I would give him a 5 mg prednisone to make him a little more comfortable.

Well, of course, the prednisone took effect and the next morning he seemed like a different cat, he was purring and eating and well, steroids are miracle drugs and I knew it was the steroid and he looked at me with a spark in his eye that said I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I knew steroids would not cure him and only give him a brief episode of relief and besides I only had 2 or 3 of them left over from a few years ago from another cat, but it was obvious he wanted to live. So I laid my hands on him and prayed and thought to myself, heck I would try Pathogen Zapper. We have nothing to lose.

I started immediately. I placed the handhelds up against each bottom of the pads on his feet. He wasn't very cooperative at first but he let me. I did three 10-minute cycles with 20-minute breaks. I did this for 3 days. During those 3 days he seemed a little better but the push the one steriod pill gave him started wearing off, he looked like he felt nauseous and seemed to be experiencing "die off" which is when bacteria and yeast and viruses start dying and overwhelm the system and make one feel fatigue and nausea. Suddenly on the 3rd night, immediately after zapping him for his 3rd cycle he started really struggling to get free and got up and immediately passed a large dark/black bowel movement the size of a cigar followed by 2 or 3 loose bowel movements. About 10 minutes later he was purring and had a lot of energy. The zapper caused a lot of bad things inside him (bacteria, virus, parasites, possibly even cancer cells) to die and caused him to have the bowel movement from hell that after he passed that fowl smelling black feces he was so much noticeably better. He walked into the kitchen and there was no more unbalanced gait! The next two days I continued to zap each day. I was also feeding him a great deal and he was doing his part by drinking water copiously. Then it happened again, he got that nausea look and fatigued and by the evening passed another fowl dark/black stool and immediately after, purring and this time actually "galloped" away into the kitchen, it wasn't actually "running" but it was a fast "gallop" and he more alive than ever. This happened one more time (last night) 3 times total.

THEN.....TODAY, GUESS WHO JUMPED UP ON MY BED PURRING SO LOUD AND MEOWING TO WAKE ME UP TO COME FEED HIM? Yep, that's right: Macaroon. And when I told him to let me sleep, he was relentless and kept up his meowing. I got up and he jumped off the bed like a healthy cat and galloped briskly into the kitchen where i fed him and he wolfed down 1/2 can of food! For the past 6 months Macaroon could barely climb into his cat box which is 5 inches from the ground, he could not jump--let alone jump up onto my tall bed and then jump down off my bed and scurry into the kitchen! His eyes are clear, when i call him he looks right at me, not all around the room as if disoriented and doesn't know where i'm at. The brown goop is almost completely gone from his ears, he purrs, he walks without swaying or out of balance. He is eating 1 whole can of cat food a day PLUS the dry food I give him. This is simply amazing.

He is still old, he still will have his weak-end failed kidney, but all the other ailments that was keeping him from living a quality life ARE GONE ! The tumor in his abdomen is smaller, it may be that it was cancerous, it's still there, but smaller. And I am going to continue the zapping for at least 30 more days. He is comfortable and responding alert and his eyes look into my eyes when i call him, he is no longer disoriented. He has put on 2 lbs in 8 days, which is a lot for a sick cat. At the end of the 30 days i am having his blood test done again and will share the results.

I know cats don't live forever, and that it is wrong to try to make them, but at least macaroon's final days or months will be quality life, without the burden of all the bacteria, parasites, and viruses on top of his old age. And he and I can very easily live with that.<br /><br />

PART 2<br /><br />
Israel, i can't talk long but i had to tell someone. macaroon had a grand mal seizure starting at the vet's office and lasting from 3:30pm to 7:30pm when i brought him home. i lay him on my bed in a warmed blanket and held him as he lay there twitching and convulsing and chewing on his tongue. the vet gave me 3 syringes of valium and muscle relaxer to give him. HOWEVER, the WEIRD thing happened. after about 30 minutes of holding him convulsing, eyes completely open and fully dialated and body shaking so bad, i decided to at least try pathogen zapper, not thinking it would do a darn thing and guess what? WITHIN 1 MINUTE OF HOLDING THE HANDHELDS TO EACH OF THE BOTTOM OF HIS FEET WHICH WERE WILDLY KICKING IN HIS SEIZURE - THEY STOPPED KICKING AND TWITCHING, WITHIN 5 MINUTES HIS CONVULSIONS STOPPED COMPLETELY AND BY THE 6TH MINUTE HE STOPPED CHEWING ON HIS TONGUE. I HELD THE ZAPPER THERE FOR 30 MINUTES AND RIGHT NOW HE IS COMPLETELY STILL ON MY BED AND NO LONGER CONVULSING. HOW ON EARTH IS THIS POSSIBLE? i mean, i KNOW the zapper is good for bacteria, virus, and parasites - but a grand mal seizure? not even the valium and muscle relaxers worked on his seizures at the vet's office. it was almost immediately after the zapper handhelds were held to his feet. Israel, this is more amazing that i ever realized. when you have a minute, please let me know what it could be that the zapper can actually STOP grand mal seizures? i am completely mystified on that one. it couldn't have been a coincidence. NOTE: macaroon is very old (minimum of 18 years old) and has kidney failure and cancer tumor and as you know he's 18 years old (possibly even older) and the zapper was instrumental in gaining his appetite back and curing his mouth ulcers and a whole slew of other things as you know i indicated in my testimonial with pictures i sent a couple months ago. nothing can help failed kidneys. but seizures? you may have something even more extraordinary with that zapper of your's than any of us ever imagined. and i seriously doubt anyone has ever tried a zapper on a grand mal seizure, mainly because most people would be on their way to the doctor's office. i'll keep you posted. -monique today he had a grand mal seizure due to electrolyte imabalance and possible potassium or calcium inbalance, which is normal for a very old cat with kidney failure.<br /><br /></p><div class="number">10</div><p>


PART 3<br /><br />

p.s. i wasn't clear in my last message and i want to be perfectly clear, the grand mal seizures stopped from pathogen zapper, WITHOUT me having to use any part of the 3 of the syringes of valium and muscle relaxer - they're still all full and intact and sitting on my dresser. the vet is the one that gave him the muscle relaxer and valium between 3pm-6pm and they only slowed his convulsions, tongue chewing (just like an eptileptic fit) and mucsle twitching down but they did NOT STOP THE SEIZURES.

he is sleeping peaceful right now.

remember when i told you i thought the zapper affected my 10+ year insomnia and caused me to fall into a deep sleep? i had told you it was in a way that seemed to affect the brain somehow, not like coming from the body when one takes a pill to sleep, because as i said in my past testimonial about pathogen zapper curing my chronic insomnia, in my old insomnia days i could drink a bottle of wine, take 2 valiums, and even amitripteline and I was still up all night and what was different about the zapper causing me to fall into a deep sleep was a mental/brain thing, meaning the zapper turned off my mind, something pills and alcohol could never do for me. it's definately ELECTRICAL as we know, but perhaps in time we can figure out. yes, i am sure the valium helped him sleep once the epileptic seizures (grand mal) stopped, but it was NOT the valium that stopped the seizure, i watched for hours after the vet gave him those injections of valium and muscle relaxers and it didn't stop the fits. it was almost immediately stopped when i applied the zapper to his feet (held them gently but firmly close to the pads of his feet).

i don't mean to talk your ear off, but dear Israel, you've really GOT something there. far more than just killing parasites and pathogens, your zapper realigns electrical/neurological impulses somehow. you're the elctrical person, FIND OUT!! this could be a big breakthrough for epilepsy.<br /><br /></p><div class="number">11</div><p>


PART 4<br /><br />

hello Israel,<br /><br />

I've attached Macaroon's latest blood test for the record. keep them for proof on pathogen zapper's ability because they are pretty incredible and that ought to shut a few mouths of people from quackwatch and such who say the zapper is a bunch of bullshevik. and i've got 3 prior tests which document all of his serious conditions dating back to 2004 showing his condition(s) were getting progressively worse--he had so many, take your pick. heck, after looking at his blood test, anyone who knows anything about reading medical tests would instantly know that there was NO hope for Macaroon, especially keeping in mind he is 18 years old--the test says "15 years old" because they guessed at his age when they filled out his paperwork, but my documented paperwork clocks him at 18 years old. and heck, since he's 18 years old (most cats do not live to even be 18 years old) they can't say he got better on his own, period! there IS no other explanation other than the zapper (and of course the prayers too, but either one - or both - is miraculous in my book). i see so many testimonials and no one includes blood or medical records to back it up--not that i doubt their veracity--but i know the quackwatch people DO. this way there is NO denying it, especially with macaroon's tests, heck it shows diabetes, anemia, chronic kidney failure, blood in the urine which is indicitve of serious condition and including cancer, and micaralbuminuria which at best if it's a false positive is indicitabe of a type of chronic infection such as cat aids, but in macaroon's case, my vet says she's thinking it might be diabetes melletes. i didn't even mention the ping-pong sized tumor that is now shrunk to the size of a jumbo olive (i wrote to you about that before and i had thought it was a bowel movement, but i see it is still there. i don't have the money to test to see if it's cancer or not, but based on macaroon's age and his other symptoms and the location of it, it probably IS cancer, lymphoma to be exact. so in 3-4 weeks i will be getting another blood test done, i will share those results too. i think the pictures speak for themselves, but too bad i didn't take any of him 2 weeks ago when he looked like an actual carcass lying on the ground--the truth is, i didn't want to because i didn't want to remember him like that. but the ones i have are good enough i think. i know you didn't set out to layout some groundbreaking veterinary breakthrough--but you DID anyway, and this is probably the best darned documented iron-clad case to back  pathogen Zapper up in regards to curing a cat. with his tests and photos, 2 vets too, not just one, there will be NO denying it for the quackwatch types. heck, the cat is 18 years old for crying out loud, and it's only been 14 days of the zapper. yes, i am doing vitamin and heavy feeding for him--but I WAS ALREADY DOING THAT FOR HIM FOR THE PAST 3-5 MONTHS but it wasn't getting me anywhere UNTIL i used your zapper. sorry to say that Macaroon is old so i don't think we can plan on him living many years, possibly not even 6 months, because our bodies just get old, but just look at those photos, especially the close-up of him, he will be old and die of old age related things, but he won't be wasting like he was with cancer or ? whatever it was (take your pick, his blood test gives any number of things, all of which are very serious in just one of them).

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR INVENTING PATHOGEN ZAPPER, THE HOURS AND TIME YOU DEVOTED INTO ALL OF YOUR WORK, EXTENDING ON THE DR. CLARK ZAPPER IS MUCH NEEDED AND APPRECIATED AND BASICALLY, HECK, IT IS GOD'S WORK TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. GOD BLESS YOU ISRAEL FOR HEEDING THE CALL AND SAYING "YES."<br /><br />

Nov. 22, 2014</p><h3>HIV</h3><div class="number">12</div><p>Dear Israel,<br /><br />

My sincerest compliments to your updated website. All the trouble you went into improving your zapper shows your commitment to informing people some or many of them desperate for answers and advice. You don't have to convince me of their effectiveness, my Dutch friend received your zapper two years ago after learning he was HIV+, in about 6 months, without any medication, his blood samples came back so good, with a viral load reading of less than 500 (mostly its at least tens of thousands if no medication is taken) that the specialist only wants to see him once a year to check the blood. He's very happy with this, and I prefer to see him use natural ways instead of popping all kinds of heavy chemicals into his body on a daily basis, even though today's HIV medication is supposed to be really good at keeping complications at bay. I was also the one (you might remember me from last year when I send you an email regarding this, who borrowed out your zapper to a Thai friend of mine who was both hiv+ and terribly suffering from TB). With no money to pay for the expensive medication, i put him on vinegar/cayenne cocktails and long zapping sessions, he's feeling much better now, TB is still present in the lungs according to xrays made last week, but at least he's not terribly sick anymore and things are way better.<br /><br />

Apr. 12, 2014</p><h3>HIV</h3><div class="number">13</div><p> Dear Israel,<br /><br />

Hope you're doing fine. And congrats still on your fine product! You may remember I'm the Dutch guy living and working in Bangkok for a non profit HIV/AIDS organisation and using your product on lots of people here. As for viral load your product seems to be working fine. Cd4 is a fluctuating number but using your product sure helps people to stay above the 200 cd 4 level (underneath that is considered clinical AIDS), whether they are on medication or not and secondary infections are almost non-existant or clear up very quickly ... I myself being hiv positive with cd4 fluctuating between 540 and 700 and undetectable viral load ...<br /><br />

All the best from Bangkok.<br />

Thought I'd give you an update. I'm feeling so much better ... I can't believe that everyone doesn't own one [Pathogen Zapper]. I will not get #'s tested for HIV for another 3 months or so, but I can significantly feel the difference in my health ... Thanks again for being the humanitarian that you are, and I often mention my protocals on the groups so that others will consider things like Pathogen Zapper, that really work.<br /><br />

Feb. 28, 2015</p><h3>HIV</h3><div class="number">15</div><p> Hello Israel,<br /><br />

I have just ordered another of your wonderful zappers as I never want to be without a backup unit. It has done absolute wonders for my HIV symptoms. I am feeling almost normal, except for my lymph nodes which are still swollen and my eyes are very red. I think I am still in detox mode and these things will eventually heal. So far I have not done any parasite tinctures or liver cleanse ... I am still not sure of how my old liver would handle all that oil. I will wait until I have had another blood test.

You mentioned in regards to one of the testimonials about major parasite expulsion that if we sent you an email you would let me know what brand the woman used. I could order the Hulda Clark stuff but am also interested in others. I did finally get a refund from my German NuLife order ... thank God they were a reputable company. I am using your zapper 3x 10 minutes with 20 minute breaks ... I will keep you posted when I have some new blood work done. Please send the zapper via xxxx Post to my Box in xxxxxxxx, as there is no panic this time. Thanks again for all your caring for others!<br /><br />

<h3>BLOOD ANALYSIS</h3><div class="number">18</div><p> Hi Israel,<br /><br />

I just wanted to give you an update on our progress. My wife and I had a microscopic blood analysis before buying your zapper. Between the two of us, out blood showed a very large infiltration of several organism types including toxoplasmosis, yeast, fungus and trichomonas. We could also see a great deal of red blood cell damage and anemia being caused by the infestation. We were considering using the toxic parasite medicines available by prescription. We only used the zapper around 8 to 10 times total for 7 minutes each session over the course of 3 weeks. After this short time frame, incredibly our new blood test showed the absence of all the parasites and most of the yeast and fungus. We also used some parasite clearing herbs, but the examiner was quite amazed at the incredibly fast result which I believe is directly related to your device. No drugs needed and tremendous results. We are very happy as you can imagine. Our blood is now utilizing B12 and other nutrients that the parasites were stealing and the free radical damage is reversing very rapidly. Your device really does work and should be a staple in every household. Thanks for your work and for providing a safe, affordable and non-toxic way for people to get well. We really appreciate it. Feel free to add my testimonial.<br />

Thank you and best regards,<br /><br />

Feb. 17, 2014</p><h3>Terminal Pancreatic Cancer</h3><div class="number">19</div><br /><br /><p>One of my relatives was given three months to live due to pancreatic cancer by a doctor. But now she is living a comparatively healthy life every day because the cancer almost disappeared after she used PZ. Detailed report: Sixty-eight years-old female (y sister in law) As she felt ill she went to the hospital and got a medical examination. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was given three months to live. She started to take focoidan along with anti-cancer drugs and did almost everything recommended by Hulda Clark. She happened to find PZ [Pathogen Zapper] on the net and started to use it as a last hope. Then after six months it turned out that her pancreatic cancer almost disappeared if not completely. She seems to attribute it to anti-cancer drugs but recently she has come to understand that anti-cancer drugs never cure cancer. Even her doctor said that such recovery was a very rare case and incredible. She is now 72 and I hear her pancreatic cancer has diminished.

... Also, my teeth, mouth, gums and jaw have been greatly affected by my use of this zapper. From time to time my teeth, gums, mouth and jaw will hurt, sometimes quite painfully. This also appears to be occurring in reverse order of the dental work I've gotten done. I used to have a very very sensitive tooth. It had a filling that almost was to the nerve. I couldn't chew on that side and I couldn't let cold or hot on that side. Then, after zapping for some time, I noticed something was going on in that area. There was pain and what I can only call "activity." I knew something was up and that my body was trying to heal that area. Then came amazingly horrible pain throughout that entire area. I was in so much pain that I would take the zapper and put it right on the area and massage the zapper in that area. That was the only thing that made the pain go down. I mean this was some really bad pain! Well, a few days after this, I noticed the tooth was no longer sensitive. It was cured! I can chew on that side - I can eat hot or cold on that side. The tooth is literally not a problem anymore. Another miracle! Thank you so much, Israel, for designing and distributing your zapper. It is an amazing effective instrument. I think we could spend decades researching all of its healing abilities.<br /><br />

Mar. 2, 2012</p><h3>EYE PROBLEMS</h3><div class="number">23</div><p>Good morning,<br /><br />

I noticed something interesting and wanted to tell you about it. I have had astigmatism in one eye, also eye floaters. I have only one eye floater left. It is a big one, but when I close my eyes I can see it has a tail that looks like the an insect wing type of composition and it is overlapped on itself. Probably dead. BTW, i am 5 months into the program Doc Sutter has, I got my zapper from you just in the last month. Also, after doing a zappins session of about a half hour, I feel this hot feeling in my eyes, then they feel really dry for a few minutes. Then this straightens out. The astigmatism had been getting worse over the years, but now, when I take off my glasses, I can notice almost no overlapping of images. Neat, huh? Don't know if it is the combination of deworming and cleansing and zapping or what. Just noticed this since I have done a few zapping sessions. Also my opthalmologist said I had the start of cataracts that really haven't gone anyplace in the last 4 years. However, I am wondering, since I can see so much better, if this is having an effect on the cataracts, too. They didn't seem to bother my vision before that I noticed. I know that is a progressive thing, but it does appear that I can see better. Have you ever heard of this? Nice things happen with all these programs. Maybe I will post this on Doc's forum in a while<br /><br />

Thanks to sound sleep, my body seems to be able to recover energy, which enables me to wake in the morning with full energy. I'm so happy now. Another change is that I soon felt the eyes were getting better. I began to feel the degree of the lenses too strong and I changed them to weaker ones. PZ also worked on myodesopsia.

July 28, 2014</p><h3>CROHN'S DISEASE</h3><div class="number">26</div><p> Hi,<br /><br />

I bought one of your Pathogen Zappers back in October and wanted to give you an update, and see if you had any suggestions. First off, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease around 1996, after about 4 years of uncertainty as to what it was. I had exploratory surgery in 1992 and they removed a 2 inch section of small intestine. They were never certain from the pathology what it was. It wasn't until an allergist prescribed Humibid, which it turns out over a period of time, will cause irritation to the digestive system, when Crohn's flared up in full force and was detectable via upper GI (in Crohn's lab in NYC no less!) Anyway, I got the zapper in October, and shortly after, the pain and cramps were reduced from a 7,8,9, or 10 (10 being "shoot me now - please" to virually 0, meaning I still have discomfort, but mostly forget about the disease.<br /><br />

Thanks a bunch,<br />
Steve<br />July 28, 2015</p><h3>Stomach Norovirus</h3><div class="number">27</div><p> <br /><br />... I also want to tell you how great the Zapper is. I can already feel a major difference in my stomach and I feel it is working on the norovirus [a contageous stomach virus that causes severe diarrhea and vomiting] I caught a few weeks ago as well as the bacteria and microbes (which I believe to be the amoeba that the nurse in India told me I had yet not surprisingly the Doctors here in Sweden could not find) . It is crazy that the western doctors could not find yet whatever I have had has put me in bed for several months. I used it the first night for 3 minutes, waited 20, turned on three minutes, waited 20 minutes, did a last time...and immediately after developed a much desired headache and a sore throat, which I know of course to be wonderful signs of detoxing... After just one day, in combination with the colloidal silver I am taking, and some other minor supplements like liquid vitamins, minerals and MSM, I feel more balanced, have more energy than I ever have and have a feeling of well being I have been desiring for a long time. I can't wait to see how I will feel in a few weeks...i wish I knew about this years ago when someone first told me about it..<br /><br />
THANK YOU ISRAEL!<br />

Nov. 29, 2013</p><h3>HIP PAIN</h3><div class="number">28</div><p> Dear Israel!<br /><br />

Thanks a lot for your email. Something wonderful happened to me today, which I want to tell you about since you take such great interest in my health (for which thank you very much indeed). For the last 2 months I have been extremely bad off (this was the bad news, the goods news will be coming later). My energy went low again, and the paralyzing symptoms which seemed to have gone or decreased to chronic pain in my head from September-December 1998 seemed to return slowly again.

From April to December I started having a terrible pain in my head. The pain seemed to get worse every day, and the last 4 weeks the pain has been completely intolerable, as it has been chronic for most of the day and late evenings. Apart from 1-2 IVCs from October-February I was off the weekly IVCs I had from June-October 1998 because of the cost (100 USD each), and I was off DMPS and DMSA because I got sick of them (I was sick of the last DMPS too). The last 3 days I have been out of my mind, because I have been running out of good ideas of what to do in order to improve my bad health condition, and everything seemed hopeless.

I have been crying a lot lately, out of mere desperation because of chronic pain and symptoms repeating themselves and getting worse, instead of getting better. And everything in my house has been in a mess for a long time, because I have have had no energy to keep the house due of constant pain in my head an other mercury related symptoms. However, with no income since Dec. 97 and up till now I could not afford to go on with this expensive treatment any longer (DMPS were 110 USD each and IVCs 100 USD each), so I found myself forced to find new ways to improve my health.<br />

I decided to see a chelating agent using acupuncture and herbal detoxification (he is half the expense of the chelating doctor using DMPS and IVCs. I consume a lot of C-vitamin powder daily, however). However, I could not get an appointment with the latter until end March, and with the pain in my head and various other symptoms I did not know how to survive for so long.<br />

Up till then I had not succeeded to make your zapper work, because I had not found a store where I could buy a 9 Volt plug. I have been trying several shops without result. And when my energy is low and I do not succeed in spite of several attempts, then I tend to resign for some time (that is probably the way it works for everybody!). However, now I have bought a 9 Volt battery and started zapping by the book 3 days ago. After two days my headache changed. From constant pain, the pain suddenly got worse, then it suddenly stopped for 30 min., then it returned and so forth for 2-3 hours. After this my pain was gone, and it has not returned for 24 hours now. The same happened to my right hipbone, which has been out of order for years. Suddenly, though I was standing still, my hipbone began aching and acting in a very peculiar manner, as if something drastic was going on inside my hip. This morning I woke up totally fresh and free of pain, as if I had been relieved from some very heavy burden that I have been carrying for years.
 I will still go on herbal chelating, continue to zap, and do the herbal kidney and liver cleanses recommended my Hulda Clark, and also follow her and your recommendations on eliminating the environmental pollution in food, detergents, cosmetics etc. I feel that I have taken a great step forward by recognizing the importance of all the things Hulda Clark state in her book.

It gives me confidence that I will cope very well in recovering this year. I still have the root canal in the upper front tooth, which might be the cause of the pain in my head. However, examinations will be made by two more specialists and an expert in Chinese medicine to see if they can find any infection around the tooth. I would like to feel sure that the tooth is the real cause, before extracting it and replacing it with a bridge, which will involve totally 3 front teeth (not least because of the cost of the bridge: approx. 3,000 USD).

However, the parasites causing the severe pain in my head may also derive from our cat. When I started reading Hulda Clarks book I realized, that the years we have had troubles with worms in our family coincide with the years we have had our cat. Actually we never succeeded of getting rid of the worms, they kept returning all the time. Perhaps some worms have evolved and found their way to my head. According to Hulda Clark this is another explanation for my severe headache. However, zapping removed the pain immediately after 3 days.

At present the cat is out of the house (my father and mother in law take care of it, because we are not allowed to keep pets in our apartment). However, I plan to give it away now that I do not feel so strongly attached to it, because it is out of the house. My daughter is crying a lot, because she too loves that cat (it was her birthday present 5 years ago). However, we have to go through this crisis, in order to avoid ruining our lives with health problems because of parasites from pets, which - acc. to Hulda Clark - will keep on returning with a pet in the house. However, I will start diagnosing the actual cause of my pain now when it is gone (hopefully forever), because I still have to do the Kidney Cleanse and Liver Cleanse recommended by you and Hulda Clark.

Thank you to both of you. In this connection I have been trying to procure borax for cleaning and washing. However, all borax products have been taken off the shelves in Denmark at present, because the Danish health authorities suspect borax to be cancerous, for which reason the product has been taken off the shelves, until examinations prove whether it is cancerous or not. Sorry, but compared to the U.S. and Canada Denmark is truly an under developed country in health issues.

The Danish health authorities prefer to do everything by themselves, they refuse to listen to or learn from important research made in the U.S. , Sweden or other countries being far ahead in health matters. This is why Denmark is so underdeveloped in health matters, because the doctors and health authorities suffer from the "small-nation-syndrome" (they think they know everything better and will not listen to foreign capacities). The Danish population as a whole is suffering due to this, because they do not get the relevant help in connection with major health problems and chronic diseases. The Danish press and one single open-minded doctor at a hospital in Copenhagen deals with this problem for the time being. The doctor has recently written a book about it, in which he accuses his own colleagues of covering the facts of the Danish health system being totally rotten, and demands that a cover-up must take place and major steps taken to change the bad health system radically.

Every Danish citizen is complaining about the bad treatment they get with health practitioners and at hospitals. Mostly, severe symptoms are neglected or rejected by health practitioners (because of overload), and by doctors and nurses at the hospital, and major mistakes involving lives are made every day (however, this mistakes are covered by the doctors and their personnel). People, who do not know how to find new ways to cure themselves are lost in this system.

Perhaps I will survive in this (as one out of few Danes), because I have the ability to find new ways to survive by drawing on foreign literature and research, and on help from persons like you, Hulda Clark an others who have found the right answers to the causes of chronic diseases. - Thank God, and bless all of you doing a good job informing people in other countries of your own good experience (this is a good thing for me or others to hang on to, when you have a chronic disease and feel completely lost in a underdeveloped country in health issues like Denmark).

I hope I will report further progress soon. Till then thank you very much once again for your emotional support.<br /><br />

Edith<br />Dec. 29, 2013</p><h3>Lyme Disease</h3><div class="number">29</div><p> Hi Israel!<br /><br />

I've been wanting to email you for a while, but I haven't had much time to get on the computer. I'm writing to thank you for the WONDERFUL little machine you built. Thanks to God, for leading me to you and Pathogen Zapper, I have my life back! In just one month after using the PZ I was cleared of Lyme Disease!

I was diagnosed with MS four years ago, but recently someone told me to get checked for Lyme, and sure enough, the results came back positive. My doctor put me on two antibiotics, Cat's Claw, and told me to get a zapper, and start zapping. I also used a Rife machine one time at the beginning of my treatment. I really believe, however, it was Pathogen Zapper that did it for me!

I didn't realize how tired I was, until I started to feel good again. I can actually stay up late, and catch up with a nap the next day, and not have to "pay" for it for the rest of the week! Every day is a celebration of being set free from the "ball and chain" of chronic fatigue! Oh yeah, by the way, I also learned that it is best to use the zapper early in the day, because it has an energizing effect? I still zap, and I'm going to continue to zap until my check-up in another month. Plus it is chasing my cold away better than anything I've tried before!

Thank you once again!<br /><br />

May God bless you!<br />

Oct. 14, 2014 </p><h3>EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)</h3><div class="number">34</div><br /><br />
<p>Okay, this is perhaps the most dramatic of all my testimonials for Pathogen Zapper. I've had extreme chronic insomnia since 1989 when I first came down with Chronic Epstein Barr Virus (CEBV). Since 2001 when I pretty much killed all the virus and parasites in my body through the Hulda Clark zapper and anti-parasite program I was never able to fully "cure" the insomnia that comes with CEBV. It is an insomnia that is so immense that I was on Elavil for years and once I even tried 2 valium and 1 bottle of wine and it didn't work, and I was "wired" up mentally and didn't sleep a wink. Yes, the body got relaxed, but the mind did NOT and thus the insomnia. For all these years the only thing that would work for me is to stay up until 2-3am and then fall asleep out of exhaustion, and then have to get up in the morning for work. I would be tired all day of course. This is VERY common for CEBV patients. However, since I started using Pathogen Zapper I actually FALL ASLEEP at 9 or 10pm while using it--this is unheard of for me to fall asleep so early. I know this is directly a result from Pathogen Zapper because I've been zapping with the Hulda Clark zapper, on the anti-candida program, anti-parasite program off and on since 2001 and never had this reaction. It is a great reaction for me and I am sleeping throughout the night now, from 10pm to the morning when i have to get up to go to work. Perhaps the mental part of the sleep problem (not being able to shut my mind down) was never affected by the past zapper or products. But Pathogen Zapper must get into the "brain fog" areas that result from CEBV...? Not sure exactly what Pathogen Zapper is doing to accomplish this, all I know is insomnia is no longer a problem for me since I started using it. The effects on my insomnia didn't come the first week of using Pathogen Zapper, it came on the 2nd week. I do 4 cycles of 10 minutes each - but now I can't stay awake long enough to do the 4th session! Insomnia was one of my worst problems because no matter how well I got or felt, without getting enough sleep I just felt tired.<br /><br />

He feels more relaxed and he is sleeping better, longer, and deeper. He is getting tired more naturally and the insomnia has not been a big problem this week, which is good.

Before getting the zapper, I had a pain in between the ribs (just below the left breast). Upon receiving the zapper for the first day, I chased this pain and it seemed to go around to the back of the shoulder blade. The next day, I can feel the "echo" of where the pain was in the rib cage. I continued to zap and after 3-4 days, there was no pain in the rib cage or around the shoulder blade. (Lymphthatic?) I still continue to use the zapper to get rid of any headaches which I have. eg. after a stressful day. Much of my headaches I have had in the past seem to accumulate at the base of the neck. This is where I apply the tubes. After a session, the headache dissappears. There must be more to the zapper than just killing off parasites. There are times in which my body is giving me a big thank you after going through a zapping session. There is a special restful or at peace feeling after I do a zapping session. Any research done in this area? I have also noticed that my skin seems to be clearing up as well.<br /><br />

Jun. 13, 2013</p><h3>MIGRAINE HEADACHES</h3><div class="number">38</div><br /><br /><p> For the past 2 years i've been getting migraine headaches, many things can trigger them, can be working at the computer for 10-12 hours; or it could be something i ate, or simply not getting enough sleep. i get them so bad i have to turn off my lights and tv because any light makes it worse, i take 4-8 advil to relieve them. I am currently on phase 1 of 3 of a heavy duty 6-month program for killing candida throughout my body and sometimes get migraine headaches as a result of the massive die-off. Anyway, the other night I had one such migraine one and normally i would take 4-6 advils just to be able to get enough relief to be able to go to sleep, but this time I decided not to take advil and used the Pathogen Zapper instead. I did 4 cycles of 10 minutes (with a 30 minute rest period in between--these cycles are mainly because I am not good at keeping time for 7-20-7-20-7-20). BUT by the 2nd cycle i felt a bit of relief, i still felt the pain, but it was DULLED PAIN, not sharp like usual and by the 4th cycle I was able to sleep without discomfort. Pathogen Zapper completely eliminated my need to take the advil.

I just love the capability of Pathogen Zapper to plug into the electrical socket and also the option of using a battery. I use the battery when I have to sit at my desk and answer phones for my job because there's no electrical socket there; and then I use the electrical plug when i zap in my room laying down relaxing.<br /><br />

Dec. 12, 2014</p><h3>PAIN IN THE NECK</h3><div class="number">40</div><br /><br /><p>Hello! I bought "Pathogen Zapper" the other day and have been using it with my wife since. I started zapping only for a minute on the first day but there was an improvement in the pain in the neck which I had had no explanation. I first doubted if it was so-called "placebo effect." But as I wasn't satisfied the result, I increased the length of the zapping time from 3 m. x 3, 7m. x 3, 10 m. x3, the pain in the neck became fairly improved. I'm now excited saying, "It's really great!" I hope that Pathogen Zapper will have a good effect on my depression and angina (my diabetes are getting better owing to diet therapy). Along with zapping, I'm now studying mega-vitamin therapy and now personally importing vitamin C, E, B complex, CoQ10, ... etc.) I hear there's "electrification" [electroporation] and I hope its effect on the absorption of such supplements.<br /><br />

Actually I'm also a MMS taker and your case is exactly what I wanted to know. I strongly agree that there are "diseases persisting Japanese people stealthly." Town doctors simply don't know about parasites. Although the Pathogen Zapper exterminates every parasite, we are constantly re-infected again and again. We had better zap ourselves vigilantly. I think Pathogen Zapper is possibly the safest way of detoxification with the fewest side-effects. Even in the terms of cost, it costs incredibly little and it is most handy of all, isn't it? True,  Pathogen Zapper is not a magic bullet and I myself use other method along with it. Nevertheless  Pathogen Zapper is the most reliable one to me.<br /><br />

Dec. 8, 2013 </p><h3>PARASITE REMEDY
and ELECTROPORATION</h3><div class="number">43</div><p>Hi Israel<br /><br />Thank you for responding so promptly ... No, I had not been zapping within an hour of taking the parasite remedy. I did that today and WOW! What a difference. I am also using this to enhance my mineral intake as well. I don't have any neurological issues, no diagnosis of that. However, there is a mineral shortage issue with Potassium causing an irregular and rapid heartbeat unless I have sufficient levels. So the doctor also prescribed oral Potassium in higher amounts. Thanks for the tip about zapping within an hour of taking the parasite herbs. I can really tell that I'm getting more use out of the parasite remedy, and not wasting it by taking large doses to compensate for how lousy I feel. This seems to be working so well that I got so much more accomplished today than I have in weeks! As long as I am feeling better I'll continue with this course of treatment and get back to the doctor when I need the tests. Do let me know if you have any other tips to share, I truly appreciate it and realize that you've had a much worse problem than I ever did, however, I did feel as though I was dying until I finally diagnosed myself ... As you know, there are many options out there for zappers - I thank whatever ANGEL sent me to your site! Many thanks again Israel and hope you're having a great day.<br /><br />

Sept. 12, 2015</p><h3>I FEEL GOOD</h3><div class="number">48</div><p>Hi Israel<br /><br /> I received the zapper & have used it about a week, starting with 1 min ... I have pouches in my bronchioles which drain at night, & I had been feeling pressure in my head & in my chest. After zapping, this past week, the pressure in the front of my head began to move to the side, & then later to the back. The pressure has greatly decreased now. After several days on the new zapper, I noticed that I was coughing up pink mucus. Yesterday, I took the parasite cleanse, but did not get a chance to zap. That evening I was coughing up bright red mucus. I zapped today, and am still coughing up some red mucus, but it has lessened a little. I think I may have had a grouping of parasites in the lung pouches. Could they be dying off, or trying to bite me or burrowing into the skin, causing it to bleed? It is not excessive & seems to want to diminish some this evening. But, I still cough up some blood every time. I don't have the pressure in my lungs now. I feel good ...<br /><br />Jan M.<br />

We did not know that we could put the hand-holds next to infected areas (like next to the nose for sinus infections or next to the throat for throat infections or on the stomach for stomach infections, etc) until we read some of the testimonies on your web-site.

Don't want to embarrass you with private stuff but I thought I would let you know what it did for me (and the animals) with just once session. I could feel it working immediately. A budding infection stopped after about an hour and my lungs stopped hurting. So, thank you for that.

For the animals, they seem to pass back and forth ear mites that, no matter how hard I work on their ears, those little buggers just won't quit. I held them on my lap and held the positive to their ear. They all stopped shaking their heads and scratching at their ears within two hours. Going to keep at it for the rest of the week just to make sure the mites stay gone.

For my spouse who fights night sweats (despite continuous herbal cleanses), he had a dry night.<br /><br />

    I'd like to report on a case in which Pathogen Zapper worked. But I'm not sure if this was the single effect of Pathogen Zapper. Last Friday my wife complained of headache and fever and went to the local doctor. Around noon she called me at my work and told me that she was diagnosed as a case of influenza type A and prescribed Tamiflu. I believe in natural care and as for Tamiflu I know the danger as well as uselessness. I think influenza itself is not so toxic and should not be afraid of so much. You can get well if you don't forget to gurgle, to wash hands and to sleep well. And I told her to stop taking Tamiflu and to go to bed soon. Getting home, I took her temperature and it registered 38.3 degrees Celsius. I squeezed Japanese strong citron and made a cup of hot citron lemonade for her in order to help perspiration and lowering the temperature. After that I zapped her only by handholds for about five minutes (this time without foot pads). The next morning her temperature lowered to around 37.8 but she still had sore throat and was unable to eat. So I made porridge of whole rice for her and went to work leaving her as she was. Arriving home, I asked how she felt and she told me the temperature was nearly normal but she still had some pain in the throat and the head. So I zapped her by handholds for about five minutes. On Saturday morning her pain in the throat and the head were almost gone. But I told her to stay in bed in case. I burned moxa to imbue her bed room and to be inhaled by her. And again I zapped her for 5 minutes as before before sleeping. On Sunday most of the symptoms like headache, sore throat, coughing and fever are gone. She was able to get up and to change clothes to spend time normally as usual. During these days I also slept beside her and zapped myself, too, thanks to which I remained un-infected throughout. The above treatment is not a single one of Pathogen Zapper but multiple one including citron lemonade, whole rice porridge and moxa incense besides zapper. But the first three might have contributed to enhance her physical strength while the last one might have resulted in killing pathogens like viruses and bacteria and the both effects benefited her fast recovery. Pathogen Zapper can be used successfully along with naturopathy. In that way you can cure diseases for good while recovering your own healing power and getting rid of pathogens. I'm convinced this helps us to enhance immunity of our bodies. The above is a report from my experience.<br /><br />

</p><h3>MORGELLONS</h3><div class="number">56</div><p><br /><br />I believe Morgellons is larvae mirgrans or something like it. We actually have something wormlike or even maggotlike, contracted from some kind of fly. They have many phases of life. In some phase they get in our ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hair and skin. When I began zapping regularly they started coming from the back of my eyes to the front and eventually I got tiny, dried out things, one here and there. I can feel the entire process because they are jumping around, which feels like a nerve jumping in your eye, but it isn't. Eventually it works its way to the front and then out to the eyelashes. I think the zapper is slowly breaking them up. I have seen many of these with a microscope, and as time goes by the new ones I get off of me are full of brownish/gray lines, almost like cracked glass. Other times it looks like it is burned just in one place which, with imagination, looks like a mouth area. When I first started zapping regularly they were making an exodus from my body. I simply pulled them off of me one by one, as I found them mostly by itchy areas and also by putting oils on my skin.<br /><br />

I have had a few liquid nitrogen treatments on it and was scheduled to go in today for another. So I got up and started my zapping cycle and on the third zap for viruses (which warts are) I zapped right on the wart. I felt better almost immediately after the first zapping and fell sound asleep and woke up feeling refreshed with no more wart pain. Thought you'd like to hear this. Looking forward to my zapping today but know I have to take it slow and steady as you say. Boy it's hard to die to our flesh and heed to the leading of God's Spirit.<br /><br />

I am now convinced I'm not just knocking at the door of my problem but that I'm breaking the door down!

At the time I was not getting sufficient sleep due to a stressful situation and as a consequence of menopause which is something that has been on-going through the years. I did sleep straight away the afternoon I used your zapper, as I would if I'd had an acupuncture treatment or taken herbs for something ... However as I could not get rid of the head cold I decided to stop using the cream (which was 3 weeks use) and started using Pathogen Zapper and lo and behold the head cold went within 2 days. I zapped for a 3 week period and felt much better again ... . I am using Pathogen Zapper for 25 seconds only. I noticed after having a rest from using it that quite a lovely feeling comes over as if meditating, particularly after the first 20 min session.<br /><br />

Oct. 4, 2014</p><h3>THYROID NODULES</h3><div class="number">75</div><p>Dear Israel,<br /><br />I am today contacting you to go over a couple of issues: One, is to share with you what I believe to be good news regarding my wife's thyroid gland disorder I was explaining in my precious emails. In summary, after refusing on her own responsibility, to be submitted to any agressive -- traditional -- medical treatment that she had started with rather unpleasant side effects and even her being mercury toxic condition, she did a three week zapping session -7/20/7/20/7 each -- once a day. As of today, almost four months have passed since she completed the zapping session and her nodules have reduced to practically nil. Though she has not gone to make another scanner ever since the date of the images I sent you in one of my previous emails, she is not feeling the discomfort associated to the disorder anymore. She is now pregnant (almost four monts already), which is very good news. This is the reason why she has not made the scanner. As soon as we have the baby with us (in just a few months from now) she will remove the dental amalgams in a mercury free dentist, do another zapping session and go to the hospital see what they have to say in light of what might probably seem to be a rather miraculous situation for the unaware. I look forward to your feedback whenever convenient to your agenda and take this opportunity to reiterate the expression of my utmost gratitude dearly for all both your device and your vision has done for the wellbeing of my wife and myself till date.

Sept. 25, 2014</p><h3>PROSTATE CANCER</h3><div class="number">80</div><p>Hi Israel,<br /><br />A close sailor friend of mine. Jonas K, has had prostatit since long. He got it once in his military service at the age of 28. Prostatit is considered to be a permanent cronical infection "down there", not to mix up with the elderly-man-prostata problems, which is something else. A man with prostatit has to be very careful to keep himself warm, never sit down on a cold chair or bench or similar i or in a cold car during the winter without first fully warming up the seats . . . . . During the years he has had several treatments with sulfa and other antibiotics but the permanent problems have not diminished. During the latest 10 years, he has felt some comfort by taking 4 pills dayly of a pollen extract (Cernitol - swedish make). He has used these pills since about 10 years. I lended him my Zapper and told him to try it: This was in the middle of June this year. Two days later he found out that he "had forgotten his pills yesterday" and the normal procedure when that has happened is to take a double dose that day to "catch up" and feel well. However, he surprisingly found that he had no pain. None at all. After just one treatment. And since then; now since more than three months, I am writing early October, he has not had any need for his pills. And he has spent quite a lot of time in his sailing yacht (as usual for him this time of the year) - and this summer has really been awfully cold this year (2007) compared to what is normal condtions during summer, here in Sweden. After just one treatment! We wonder how long it will stay like this.<br /><br />

Aug. 5, 2014</p><h3>MENSTRUAL BLEEDING</h3><div class="number">83</div><p>Dear Mr Alagbe,<br /><br />Firstly can I say how wonderful your zapper is! It is the only thing that has got my chronic candida under control after 20 years of suffering. I don't know what I would do without it! ...

Feb. 20, 2015</p><h3>CANDIDA</h3><div class="number">84</div><p>Question:<br /><br />Last Tuesday evening I zapped for an hour. But I didn't get hit with the heavy die off until Thursday/Friday. Does candida die right away upon getting zapped, or is there a delay, which would explain my delay in die off? Then, all kinds of ulgy candida with long tennacles started coming out over the weekend. Thanks.<br /><br />

Sept. 19, 2015</p><h3>CANDIDA</h3><div class="number">85</div><p>Thanks Israel<br /><br />I saw such a huge difference with my skin regarding ecxema, I realized I had Candida and within a few days of starting the zapping as you recommended my flare-ups stopped and my skin was no longer ichy and finally began to heal. I also feel an abundance of energy after zapping especially when I put the bars on my wrist 30 minutes after taking vitamins. I'm full of energy all and I've been in a great mood every since. People at work have noticed and are asking me what I've been doing.

Thanks again for spreading the message about this wonderful product.<br />

Apr. 13, 2014</p><h3>CANDIDA</h3><div class="number">85</div><p>Hi Israel<br /><br />Thanks for your quick reply. After zapping last night I felt instantly better for the first time ever! Wow was it great. I think the reason why is I got rid of my parasites and my body was able to heal a little ... I think I've had candida all my life ... I did read the candida testimonials on your sites and they gave me encouragement. The thing that really was exciting was reading that some people experienced hair growth ... which I really need ... Thanks for your machine. For the first time I can feel good health is out there just waiting for me. BTW I'm getting much further by not using a doc ... . Also, you are one of the only people connected with zappers that has testimonials because our worthless FDA has made American sites take them down. I hope you know you're blessed because you're blessing other lives -- like mine. Thank you again.<br /><br />

May 26, 2014</p><h3>NIGHT SWEATS</h3><div class="number">87</div><p>Dear Israel<br /><br />Thank you for this amazing equipment! It is excellent! On my personal example I have been assured that it is fantastic. Candida symptoms I had were drawn-back after the first treatment and I am very happy for that. Another zapper was delivered to a friend of mine. He felt changes after the first treatment as well. He used to have a very bad night sweating for years. He used to wake up and change sleeping cloths 3-4 times per night. After the first zapper treatment sweating is so negligible and almost diminished. Thank you once again. We will continue using the zapper ...<br />

Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />

Best Regards,<br />
